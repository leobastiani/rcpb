# Installation

A good advice is to install [nvm-sh](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) on Linux/Mac or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) on Windows, and then install node version 14.15.1 with `nvm install 14.15.1`.
Finally install the tool globally using this command:

```bash
npm install -g rcpb
```

# Getting Started

Start hacking with your terminal.

```bash
rcpb <strings>...
```
